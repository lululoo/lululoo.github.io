## Getting Started

Run:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Deployments

Files are statically generated and 'deployed' into the `docs` directory, which get served as GitHub pages.

After making any changes, run: `npm run deploy` and commit the changes in the `docs` directory.

A GitHub action on the repo will kick off and deploy the latest content.
